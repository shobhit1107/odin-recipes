        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>250 grams or 330 grams Classic Pizza Dough Flour, for dusting</li>
            <li>80 grams crushed tomatoes </li>
            <li>100 grams fresh mozzarella, torn into pieces</li>
            <li>5 grams extra-virgin olive oil</li>
            <li>Handful of basil leaves</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li><p>Fire up your Ooni oven. Aim for  500 ˚C (930 ˚F) on the stone baking board inside. You can check the temperature inside your oven quickly and easily using an infrared thermometer.</p></li>
            <li><p>Using a small amount of flour, dust your work surface and your pizza peel. </p></li>
            <li><p>Stretch the pizza dough ball out to 12 or 16 inches (30 or 41 centimetres) and lay it out on your pizza peel.</p></li>
            <li><p>Top with sauce, followed by the mozzarella and olive oil, spreading both evenly on the dough and leaving room for the cornicione, or crust (about a ½ inch or 1 centimetre).</p></li>
            <li><p>Slide the pizza off the peel and into your oven and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, making sure to rotate the pizza every 20 seconds for an even bake.</p></li>
            <li><p>Once cooked, remove the pizza from the oven and top with whole, fresh basil leaves.</p></li>
            <li><p>Slice, serve and enjoy!</p></li>
        </ol>
